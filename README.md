# NFTs
To explore and show how to create and use NFTs with python and Erthereum

## Prerequisities

- Python
- Node JS & npm
- Hardhat
- MetaMask
- Twitter Account
- 

We are going to create random art attributes that will be able to be amalgamated together through python code, then we will further tokenize our NFTs. in python, where we can later mint them using blockchain technology and our solaris smartcontracts.

## NFT Tokenization

You will find in raw_images, the art attributes that will be used to create our NFT images. In this folder you will find subfolders for each attibute category which is based on location in the image. Then we can use the code in the NFT_tutorial which will show insight how to generate and tokenize your NFTs and also create metadata which is where your NFTs come to life.


## Connecting to Ethereum Blockchain

First off we need to set up our respective blockchain accounts and wallets. We decided to use MetaMask as the blockchain wallet. A wallet runs as a self-contained application inside of your browser as an extension. It allows you to interact with Decentralised Applications. MetaMask makes accessing the Ethereum and Testnet blockchains very easy and provides you with wallet addresses. To install it:

Go to https://metamask.io and install the browser extension in Chrome or Firefox
Once downloaded it should redirect you to an onboarding screen, but if not click on the MetaMask icon in your extensions
Create a new wallet
During setup you will be presented with a secret phrase, copy and keep it somewhere secure where nobody else can access it
Once you've created your wallet you'll see that you are based on the Ethereum Mainnet network. Change this so that you're on the Rinkeby Test Network

To complete this tutorial successfully we will need some Rinkeby ETH and Rinkeby Link, which are Ethereum and Chainlink, respectively. We will use ETH to deploy out smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and to get data from off-chain we will use our Chainlink. Chainlink is what is refered to as Blockchain Oracke, in short it is the middleware between the real world, and the blockchain world.
